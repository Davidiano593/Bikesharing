- In this image we can see that the majority of users of the program are male, which are almost 300% higher than female or undefined users, in the same way the most common time of use is 5 minutes, personally I can deduce that between 1 and 20 minutes are the times that recorded the largest number of rides

## Summary

- The citibike program is the largest in the world with around 2,344,000 rides throughout the city, it has helped many New Yorkers to get around in a more efficient and cleaner way, so this data helps many other cities to follow suit. and try to implement this program. In the following link we will be able to observe the dashboards and the history of Tableau with the summarized information of the trips by hour and gender, which will help other companies in decision making.

- My personal recommendation is that they direct citibike marketing a little more towards the female gender since they are the ones who use it the least. In addition, carry out the maintenance of the bicycles between 2:00 and 3:00 AM since it is the time that fewer people use the bicycles and have the greatest number of bicycles available between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM since it is the time more busy
